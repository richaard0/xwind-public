# xwind

Xwind is a mobile-first web application designed for pilots, flight dispatchers or any other aviation enthusiasts. 

It makes it easy to gather real-time and forecasted wind information for any runway at a given airport. 
For Canadian airports, it also helps making operational decisions based on the CRFI index and crosswind limitation. 

In the future, Xwind will also feature smart Notams filtering, near real-time weather alerting and even more.

This repository also features some helping functions and files designed to help build the web application itself but that might not also be present in the web application itself.

Xwind is available to be used in its current form at https://www.xwind.app
